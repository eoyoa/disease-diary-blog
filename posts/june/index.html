            <h2>Food Poisoning</h2>

            <h3 id="causes-risk-factors">Causes/Risk Factors</h3>
                <p>When a harmful bacterium, virus, or parasite enters the body through ingestion, the victim often gets food poisoning. Harmful bacteria include E. coli, salmonella, and many more (FDA, 2018). These agents can contaminate food at any point of production, but cross contamination is often the cause. Raw foods are also more likely to have these agents, as they are not cooked to destroy most harmful agents. Certain ages and health conditions could determine the likelihood of one getting a foodborne illness. The most vulnerable groups are older adults, pregnant women, young children, and chronic disease patients (Mayo Clinic 2017).</p>
            <h3 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h3>
                <p>Symptoms of food poisoning often consist of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, cramps, and a fever. However, more severe cases could have bloody vomit or stool, dehydration, and neurological symptoms (Mayo Clinic 2017).</p>
            <h3 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h3>
                <p>The most common method of food poisoning diagnosis is through analysing the patient's history, specifically the length of the sickness, symptoms, and foods the patient has ingested. Other lab tests may be in order depending on symptoms and health history. However, sometimes the cause of food poisoning cannot be identified (Mayo Clinic 2017).</p>
            <h3 id="prevention">Prevention</h3>
                <p>To prevent food poisoning, one can be clean and careful about what they eat. They should wash their hands, utensils, and surfaces often. They should keep raw food from potential cross contamination sources and cook foods to safe temperatures. They should also refrigerate their foods as soon as they can, defrost food properly, and dispose of food of which they are unsure about (Mayo Clinic 2017).</p>
            <h3 id="prognosis">Prognosis</h3>
                <p>Symptoms can appear mere hours after consuming contaminated food, or much longer. However, the symptoms usually last only a few hours to a couple days. Hospital admittance is rarely necessary, but it is possible depending on the severity of the illness. Dehydration is a common complication. Depending on the type of food poisoning, one could also get more serious infections like E. coli infections or listeria infections (Mayo Clinic 2017).</p>
            <h3 id="treatment">Treatment</h3>
                <p>Food poisoning can often resolve without treatment in a couple days. However, medicine and home remedies can be used to alleviate some of the pain. Other treatments like lost fluid replacement and antibiotics may be necessary for more severe cases (Mayo Clinic 2017).</p>
            <h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>
                <p>Food poisoning rarely has any long term effects on a person. However, certain cases like E. coli and listeria can have long lasting complications (Mayo Clinic 2017).</p>
