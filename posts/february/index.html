            <h2>Fragile X Syndrome</h2>
            <a title="Peter Saxon [CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)], via Wikimedia Commons" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fragx-1.jpg"><img width="512" alt="Fragx-1" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Fragx-1.jpg/512px-Fragx-1.jpg"></a>
            <h3 id="causes-risk-factors">Causes/Risk Factors</h3>
                <p>Fragile X syndrome is caused by mutations in the FMR1 gene, which holds the instructions for the protein FMRP. The specific mutation is most often in the CGG triplet repeat, which is repeated much more than normal. FMRP is responsible for regulating the production of other proteins and also is a factor in the development of synapses, which are critical for relaying nerve impulses (Genetics Home Reference, 2019).</p>
            <h3 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h3>
                <p>Because of the irregular development of synapses and production of proteins, developmental issues and distinct physical features are often found in Fragile X patients. Female patients are less likely to be impacted, however. Children with Fragile X usually have anxiety or hyperactive behavior, with the hyperactive behavior usually in the form of ADD. A third of Fragile X patients have impacted communication and social interaction akin to patients of autism, and seizures are uncommon but still prevalent in Fragile X patients. Distinct physical features such as a long and narrow face, large ears, a prominent jaw and forehead, unusually flexible fingers, flat feet, and in males, macroorchidism after puberty are often found in patients (Genetics Home Reference, 2019).</p>
            <h3 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h3>
                <p>Fragile X can usually be diagnosed with 4 approaches: physical exams, lab testing, and personal and family medical history analysis (Genetics Home Reference, 2019). Prenatal testing and developmental screening could also be used to diagnose Fragile X (NIH, 2016).</p>
            <h3 id="prevention">Prevention</h3>
                <p>Like most genetic diseases, Fragile X cannot necessarily be prevented. Genetic testing could be done to see if potential parents have the possibility of having a child with Fragile X, but once conception occurs, it cannot as of present be prevented (STTI, n.d.).</p>
            <h3 id="prognosis">Prognosis</h3>
                <p>Fragile X patients usually don't have affected life spans. However, they are more prone to ear infections and seizures (GARD, 2015).</p>
            <h3 id="treatment">Treatment</h3>
                <p>A general treatment does not exist for Fragile X, as of present. Its symptoms could however be treated, through special education for patients with developmental and intellectual disabilities, medications for behavioral issues, and routine checkups for common symptoms that come with Fragile X (GARD, 2015).</p>
            <h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>
                <p>Apart from developmental issues and distinct physical features, Fragile X does not have many other effects. They are more prone to certain ailments, like seizures and ear infections, but their life spans are not found to be affected (GARD, 2015).</p>
