            <h3 id="causes-risk-factors">Causes/Risk Factors</h3>
                <p>African Sleeping Sickness or Trypanosomiasis is mainly caused by an infected tsetse fly. However, it can be transmitted through other forms of contact, such as unborn children in an infected mother's uterus, intercourse, or blood transfusion (WHO, 2018). However, these are very rare cases (CDC, 2012).</p>
            <h3 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h3>
                <p>There are 2 stages of Trypanosomiasis: the first stage, the haemo-lymphatic stage and the second stage, the meningo-encephalic stage. In the haemo-lymphatic stage, symptoms often consist of fever, headaches, joint pains and itching (WHO, 2018). In the meningo-encephalic stage, symptoms consist of changes of behaviour, confusion, sensory disturbances, poor coordination, and disturbance of the sleep cycle, from which the disease derived its name from (WHO, 2018).
            <h3 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h3>
                <p>Trypanosomiasis is diagnosed in 3 steps: The first step is screening for potential infection, which involves studying bodily fluids and serums and checking for signs of Trypanosomiasis like swollen cervical lymph nodes. After, bodily fluids are examined to see if the parasite is present in the patient. Finally, staging is used to determine the state of disease progression, which includes examining the spinal fluid (WHO, 2018). </p>
            <h3 id="prevention">Prevention</h3>
                <p>There is no vaccine or drug against Trypanosomiasis, making prevention very important. Prevention is done by avoiding contact with tsetse flies. One should wear neutral colored long-sleeved shirts and pants that are not thin and blend with the background environment, as tsetse flies are attracted to colors that contrast with the environment and also can bite through thin clothing. Vehicles should also be inspected before being used, as the flies are attracted to the motion and dust vehicles generate. Bushes should be avoided, as that is where tsetse flies reside. While insect repellents with Permethrin are not effective against tsetse fly bites, they should be used to avoid getting bitten by other insects.</p>
            <h3 id="prognosis">Prognosis</h3>
                <p>Trypanosomiasis has 2 main forms: T. b. rhodesiense or T. b. gambiense. T. b. rhodesiense infection, which is common in East Africa, progresses quickly. Sometimes, a large sore will develop at the site of the tsetse bite. Most patients get fever, headache, muscle and joint aches, and enlarged lymph nodes within 1-2 weeks of the  bite. Some people develop a rash. After a few weeks of infection, the parasite eventually causes neurologic problems like mental deterioration. Death usually occurs within months. T. b. gambiense infection, found in West Africa, progresses more slowly. In the beginning there may be only mild symptoms like coming and going fevers, headaches, muscle and joint aches, and discomfort. Itching of the skin, swollen lymph nodes, and weight loss can also occur. After 1-2 years, personality changes, daytime sleepiness with nighttime sleep disturbance, and progressive confusion occur. Other signs such as partial paralysis, problems with balance or walking, or hormonal imbalances may occur. Untreated infection rarely lasts longer than 6-7 years and often leads to death in about 3 years (CDC, 2012).</p>
            <h3 id="treatment">Treatment</h3>
                <p>Trypanosomiasis is treated based on the stage the victim is currently in. The first stage is safer and easier to cure, as the parasite has not crossed the blood-brain barrier yet. In the first stage, drugs like Pentamidine and Suramin may be used. In the second stage, Melarsoprol, Eflornithine, and Nifurtimox may be used (WHO, 2018).</p>
            <h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>
                <p>Left untreated, African Sleeping Sickness can lead to severe illness. It most definitely leads to death.</p>
