                <p>
                    St. Louis Encephalitis (STE) is transmitted to humans from birds via mosquito bite.
                    Some risk factors for STE are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Age - being over 70 increases your risk by tenfold</li>
                    <li>Sex - being male increases your risk</li>
                    <li>Exposure to the virus</li>
                    <li>Having atherosclerosis, heart disease, and hypertension alongside STE - associated with an increased mortality rate</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    (Medscape, 2015)
                </p>
            <h3 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h3>
                <p>
                    STE has 2 stages of symptoms. The first stage comes with fever, headache, dizziness, nausea, and discomfort. After, patients could recover or receive the second stage of symptoms, which include stiff neck, confusion, disorientation, dizziness, tremors and unsteadiness. In extreme cases, coma could occur (CDC, 2018).
                </p>
            <h3 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h3>
                <p>
                    STE can be diagnosed in a variety of ways. It can be diagnosed through patient conditions and analysis of patient travel history. It can also be diagnosed in a lab by testing cerebrospinal fluid of virus-specific IgM and neutralizing antibodies. Specialized laboratory testing could also diagnose STE in fatal cases (CDC, 2018).
                </p>
            <h3 id="prevention">Prevention</h3>
                <p>
                    To prevent getting infected with STE, insect repellent and long sleeved clothing should be used to avoid getting mosquito bites. Points of entry into one’s house should be screened and closed as much as possible, and areas with standing water should be frequently cleaned, as to avoid mosquito eggs from hatching (CDC, 2018).
                </p>
            <h3 id="prognosis">Prognosis</h3>
                <p>
                    Symptoms of STE can be fairly mild, but in extreme cases the symptoms may be severe. Mortality caused by STE is low, with a majority of casualities being old (Medscape, 2015).
                </p>
            <h3 id="treatment">Treatment</h3>
                <p>
                    There is no current vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for STE as of 2018. STE patients are instead treated with supportive care (CDC, 2018).
                </p>
            <h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>
                <p>
                    Survivors of STE may gain consequential conditions, including irritability, memory loss, movement disorders, or motor deficits (Medscape, 2015).
