            <h2>The Zika Virus</h2>
            <a title="By James Gathany [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aedes_aegypti_during_blood_meal.jpg"><img width="512" alt="Aedes aegypti during blood meal" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Aedes_aegypti_during_blood_meal.jpg"></a>
            <h3 id="causes-risk-factors">Causes/Risk Factors</h3>
                <p>
                    The Zika Virus can be transmitted through a variety of ways.
The most common means of transmission are from bites of infected Aedes species mosquitoes. Aedes species mosquitoes often lay eggs near standing water, making buckets, vases, bowls, and other containers with water potential areas of risks.
It can also be transmitted from mother and child interactions, like pregnancy and breastfeeding.
Another way it could be transmitted is through sexual intercourse. An infected person’s bodily fluids could have traces of the virus, so even if symptoms are not present, the virus could still be transmitted. 
There are other rare reports of transmission from other sources, like blood transfusions or laboratory/healthcare setting exposure but a majority of these reports are unconfirmed (CDC, 2018).
                </p>
            <h3 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h3>
                <p>
                    The most common symptoms of the Zika Virus are fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, and muscle pain. They are often mild and may not even be present (CDC 2018).
                </p>
            <h3 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h3>
                <p>
                    The Zika Virus may be diagnosed through analysis of patient symptoms and travel history, as well as through blood or urine tests (CDC 2018).
                </p>
            <h3 id="prevention">Prevention</h3>
                <p>
                    To prevent transmission of the Zika Virus, insect repellent and long sleeved clothing should be used to avoid getting mosquito bites. Points of entry into one’s house should be screened and closed as much as possible, and areas with standing water should be frequently cleaned, as to avoid mosquito eggs from hatching. Travel destinations marked as areas of risk by the CDC should be avoided. Abstinence or using physical protection during intercourse should be practiced, as the Zika Virus can be transmitted through seminal and vaginal fluids (CDC, 2018).
                </p>
            <h3 id="prognosis">Prognosis</h3>
                <p>
                    In a majority of patients, the Zika Virus is fairly mild, with only light symptoms lasting a period of 2-7 days. Fatalities are extremely uncommon, with only 1 case of death being associated with the Zika Virus. However, the victim was elderly, and also had an undisclosed health condition (BMJ, 2018).
                </p>
            <h3 id="treatment">Treatment</h3>
                <p>
                    As of 2018, there is no specific medicine or vaccine for the Zika Virus. However, the Zika Virus could still be treated. The victim should get plenty of rest and hydration, as well as take fever and pain reducing medicines like Tylenol. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin should be avoided to reduce the risk of bleeding until dengue can be ruled out (CDC, 2018).
                </p>
            <h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>
                <p>
                    The Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects like severe microcephaly, decreased brain tissue with a specific pattern of brain damage, damage to the back of the eye, joints with limited range of motion, and restricted body movement soon after birth due to muscle tone.
Guillain-Barré syndrome is also strongly suggested to be associated with the Zika Virus by current CDC research, but there are relatively few people who have GBS caused by the Zika Virus (CDC, 2018).
