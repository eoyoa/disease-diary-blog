            <h2>Becker Muscular Dystrophy</h2>
            <a title="A2-33 [CC BY-SA 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:3b6r.png"><img width="256" alt="3b6r" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/3b6r.png"></a>
            <h3 id="causes-risk-factors">Causes/Risk Factors</h3>
                <p>Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) is caused by a mutation in the DMD gene which gives instructions on how to make dystrophin, a protein that helps stabilize and protect muscle fibers. This mutation causes it to make abnormal dystrophin that in turn causes the damaging of muscle cells. It is X-linked recessively linked, which means males are more often the victims of BMD (GARD 2016).</p>
            <h3 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h3>
                <p>Symptoms of BMD are usually muscular weakness in the legs and pelvis and weakness of the heart (dilated cardiomyopathy). Other symptoms like cognitive problems, fatigue, loss of balance and coordination, problems breathing, and muscular weakness in the arms, neck and other areas of the body have occured, but are not as common (GARD 2019).</p>
            <h3 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h3>
                <p>BMD is often diagnosed through neurological and muscle exams, as well as specific lab tests. Medical history is also examined, as BMD and Duchenne muscular dystrophy are similar and easily mistaked for another (GARD 2016).</p>
            <h3 id="prevention">Prevention</h3>
                <p>Because BMD is genetic, there is no way that it can be prevented.</p>
            <h3 id="prognosis">Prognosis</h3>
                <p>BMD usually leads to a varying amount of slowly worsening disability. Lifespans of patients with BMD are often shortened due to the heart and respiratory complications that come with BMD. Most patients live to mid or late adulthood, and could possibly live a normal life span if BMD is treated well (GARD 2016).</p>
            <h3 id="treatment">Treatment</h3>
                <p>There is no cure for BMD and treatment options are usually just supportive care. Patients often go through physical therapy and are encouraged to lead active lifestyles, as inactivity worsens the effects of BMD. Patients are usually closely monitored for complications (GARD 2016).</p>
            <h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>
                <p>BMD generally affects the leg and pelvis muscles, but can affect many other muscles. As the heart is a muscle, it can lead to heart issues (MDA).</p>
