            <h2>Ringworm</h2>

            <h3 id="causes-risk-factors">Causes/Risk Factors</h3>
                <p>
                    Ringworm can be caught from a carrier of the infection or the fungus that causes the infection itself.
                    Some risk factors for ringworm are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weak immune systems - increased risk of getting a ringworm infection and more difficulty fighting off infection</li>
                    <li>Public shower/locker room use - damp conditions present in such places are what fungi thrive in</li>
                    <li>Close contact with animals - animals are also carriers of ringworm</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    (CDC, 2017)
                </p>
            <h3 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h3>
                <p>
                    Symptoms of ringworm include itchy skin, a ring-shaped rash, red scaly cracked skin, and hair loss. They typically appear 4 - 14 days from initial contact with the fungus. They can infect nearly any part of the body, including nails (CDC, 2015).
                </p>
            <h3 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h3>
               <p>
                   Ringworm can be diagnosed through inspection of the affected area and symptoms of the patient. A small skin scraping may also be used to aid in diagnosis (CDC, 2015).
               </p>
            <h3 id="prevention">Prevention</h3>
                <p>
                    To prevent getting ringworm, one should be generally hygienic and groom themselves well. They should wear shoes that keep air circulation high around their feet as to prevent sweat buildup and avoid being barefoot in places like locker rooms and public showers. When interacting with a carrier of ringworm, they should be cautious and sanitary (CDC, 2017).
                </p>
            <h3 id="prognosis">Prognosis</h3>
                <p>
                    Ringworm can have complications that lead to death, like deep and widespread infections (Verywell, 2018). However, this is very unlikely as ringworm is easily treatable and has extremely high cure rates of 70 - 100% (Medscape, 2018).
                </p>
            <h3 id="treatment">Treatment</h3>
                <p>
                    Ringworm on the skin can be treated with OTC products like Clotrimazole, Miconazole, Terbinafine, and Ketoconazole. Ringworm on the skin usually is treated with RX products like Griseofulvin, Terbinafine, Itraconazole, and Fluconazole (CDC, 2015).
                </p>
            <h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>
                <p>
                    There are often no long-term effects that come with ringworm. However, there can be complications like spreading, dark marks, secondary infections, abscesses, or deep and widespread infections. These are rare and should not be a problem for many however (Verywell, 2018).
