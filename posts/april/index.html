            <h3 id="causes-risk-factors">Causes/Risk Factors</h3>
                <p>Cercarial Dermatitis or swimmer's itch is a parasitic disease that becomes waterborne through their hosts' feces. Their hosts are waterfowl and animals that live near ponds and lakes, which makes ponds and lakes the most likely area of infection. Some people are more sensitive to swimmer's itch, and sensitivity can increase the more times you are exposed to the parasites caused by swimmer's itch (MFMER 2018).</p>
            <h3 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h3>
                <p>There are not many symptoms of swimmers itch. The only recognized symptom of swimmer's itch is rashing that looks like reddish pimples or blisters (MFMER 2018).</p>
            <h3 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h3>
                <p>Swimmer's itch does not have any specific tests for diagnosis, and it can be difficult to diagnose swimmer's itch as it's only symptom can look like other conditions (MFMER 2018). However, since this condition is not very harmful and has similar symptoms to other conditions, it can be treated relatively the same way.</p>
            <h3 id="prevention">Prevention</h3>
                <p>To prevent swimmer's itch, one should choose swimming spots carefully and avoid places that are known to have swimmer's itch, such as marshy areas where snails are found. One should also avoid the shoreline as they are more likely to develop swimmer's itch the longer they are in warmer water near the shore. Of course, people should be hygenic and rinse after swimming. Their swimsuits should also be laundered. Birds near swimming areas should not be fed to avoid contaminated defecation from getting into swimming water. Finally, waterproof sunscreen has been reported to protect the skin from the parasite that causes swimmer's itch (MFMER 2018). One could also just swim in their swimming pool, as snails that are contaminated must be present to transmit swimmer's itch (CDC 2018).</p>
            <h3 id="prognosis">Prognosis</h3>
                <p>Swimmer's itch rarely leads to complications, but infections could occur if the rash is scratched too vigorously (MFMER 2018).</p>
            <h3 id="treatment">Treatment</h3>
                <p>Swimmer's itch rarely requires medical attention (CDC 2018). It could clear up on its own within a week, but itching can be controlled with OTC antihistamines or anti-itch creams. Severe itching could prompt prescription medication (MFMER 2018).</p>
            <h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>
                <p>Swimmer's itch does not have any long-term effects on the body. Its only symptom is short-term rashing (MFMER 2018).</p>
